			<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<h2>Subject</h2>			
					<p>The initial subject, available <a href="http://www-inf.it-sudparis.eu/COURS/ASR/projets/sujet_OlivierBerger_AndreiSambra.pdf">here</a> (document furnished in French), expressed two guidelines to follow:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A WebID identity provider ;</li>
						<li>This provider had to be portable</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The project enter in the current issue of the <em>distributed social netwworks</em>. The idea develop here is to enable people to control the acces of his own information by having his own server which contains all his own data. Therefore the social network has no more control on your data.</p>

							<figcaption>Architectures of a traditionnal social network (as Facebook) and a distributed social network (like for example Diaspora). </figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Hence the principal goal of the project is to improve the solutions furnished to develop and use WebID protocol in order to enable an easy log on on social networks but also the control on access to your data.</p>
			<h1>Domain analysis</h1>
				<h2>WebID</h2>
					<div class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: the following describes WebID in its "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/drafts/ED-webid-20111212">W3C Editor's Draft 12 December 2011</a>" <span class="ref">Henry Story et al., <em>WebID 1.0</em>, [Online]. Available: http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/</span> version. It may have changed since; the latest version is available on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/" target="_blank">W3C website</a>.</div>
					<h3>More than authentication</h3>
						<p>Because WebID uses a RDF file to store information about the user, it can handle any RDF informations.</p>
						<p>A WebID <span class="ref">,<em>WebIDs and the WebID Protocol</em> [Online]. Available: http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebID</span> is a way to uniquely identify a person, company, organization, or other agent using a URI. The term "WebID" was coined by Dan Brickley and Tim Berners-Lee in 2000.</p>
						<p>The WebID Protocol authenticates a digital identity by allowing an Agent (e.g., a Web Browser) to prove possession of or access to a private key, whose corresponding public key is tightly bound to this WebID. The private key is usually associated with a "certificate" on the user's computer, while the public key and WebID are defined in the FOAF file of the subject and described by a URI in the certificate.</p>
						
						<h4>SSL/TLS security protocol</h4>
						<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) <span class="ref">T. Dierks, E. Rescorla,<em>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol, Version 1.2</em>, August 2008; http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebID</span> and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide communication security over the Internet.</p>
						<p>The TLS protocol allows client/server applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering. The goals of the TLS protocol is to provide: cryptographic security, interoperability, extensibility, relative efficiency. Therefore it provides these different security aspects :</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The authentification of the server</li>
							<li>An encrypted session which allows secure data transmission</li>
							<li>The integrity of exchanged data</li>
							<li>The use of a certificate to authenticate the client</li>
							<li>The transparency of the connection for the client</li>
							<li>The transparency for the http protocol (allows the same query in https than in http)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In the WebID protocol, the client must have a X509 certificate<span class="ref">R. Housley et al., <em>Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure</em>, IETF RFC 5280, May 2008; http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt</span> with a subject alternative name URI entry that dereferences to a document which contains the public key for that certificate.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="img/certificate.jpg" title="Certificate TLS" />
							<figcaption>Example of X509 certificate used in WebID protocol. </figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>For now, one of the main critic is that SSL (TLS) is required to use WebID. Although it is a problem for now, there are more and more people believing that the web will be turned into "HTTPS only" soon <span class="ref">,<em></em> [Online]. Available: http://vitobotta.com/why-isnt-ssl-on-by-default-for-all-websites/</span>. For instance, google or facebook are now available in "SSL only" mode. </p>
						
						<h4>FOAF ontology</h4>
						<p><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/" target="_blank">FOAF</a> (an acronym of Friend of a friend) is a machine-readable ontology based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF) and describing persons, their activities and their relations to other people and objects. Indeed FOAF allows groups of people to describe social networks without the need for a centralised database: all the relations between people are described in FOAF files.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="img/foaf-spec.jpg" title="FOAF ontology" />
							<figcaption>Graph of FOAF ontology</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>The FOAF Ontology is used in the WebID protocol with accordance to the following graph :</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="img/foafssl-graph.jpg" title="FOAF + SSL graph" />
							<figcaption>Graph of a FOAF profile in WebID</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>In this graph the uri <em>https://bob.example/profile#me</em> links to the FOAF file which describe Bob profile. </p>

						<h4>Authentication Sequence</h4>
						<p>In order to give the full context of a Client interaction with a Server we will illustrate the protocol with the following sequence diagram.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="img/webid-sequence.jpg" title="WebID athentification sequence" />
							<figcaption>In this figure Bob initiates a connection to Alice's server in order to access a protected resource.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<!-- TO DO finir -->
						<ol>
							<li>Initialization of the TLS Connection 
								<ul>
									<li>This may be done as the first part of an HTTPS connection.</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Connection at the Application Layer 
								<ul>
									<li>An agent, usually on the Server, called the guard is responsible for lookint at a request from the Client and decide if it needs authentication (Access control Rules or webID Verifier).</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Request of the Client Certificate
								<ul>
									<li>The guard requests of the TLS agent that it make a <em>certificate request</em> to the client.</li>
									<li>The client asks Bob to choose a certificate (compatible with WebID protocol).</li>
									<li>The TLS agent verifies that the client is indeed in possession of the private key contains in the certificate chosen and its validity.</li>
									<li>Then the TLS agent passes the certificate to the guard.</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Verification of the WebIDs
								<ul>
									<li>The Guard asks the verification agent to perform the WebID part of the authentification.</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Extraction of Bob's public key
								<ul>
									<li>The verification agent extracts the public key and all the URI entries (which are called WebIDs) contained in the <em>Subject Alternative Name</em> extension of the certificate.</li>
									<li>One of the WebIDs is verified if <!-- Là je sais pas trop quoi dire --></li>
								</ul></li>
							<li>Checking of the access control rules (the exact nature of those Access Control Rules is left for another specification)</li>
							<li>Access to the protected ressource</li>

					<h3>W3C</h3>
						<p>Getting the status of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/about.html" target="_blank">W3C Recommendation</a> helps to <q cite="http://www.w3schools.com/web/web_standards.asp">make the web a better place</q> by allowing both developers and users to have a better web experience. During one year from January 2011, WebID was developed through a W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/" target="_blank">Incubator Group</a> (XG) which is usually (but not mandatory) the first step in the recommendation redaction process. Members of Incubator Groups are authorized to use W3C infrastructures (such as mailing-list, wiki, bug tracker, ...) and permits to gather experts and every people interested in a technology in one location. It's a process open to anyone, for free; but because the process is based on consensus, it's quite hard to make decision with large number of people.</p>
						<p>Most of discussions are made through the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-webid/" target="_blank">public-xg-webid@w3.org</a> <span title="from October 2011 to January 2012, in average more than 400 e-mails are exchanged each month">mailing list</span>. There are also Teleconference meetings (accessible by phone, <span title="Session Initiation Protocol: Voice over IP equivalent">SIP</span>, IRC...) every month which permits do decide what to focus on during the following weeks.<p>
						<p>On January 2012, WebID XG was turned into a <a href="http://www.w3.org/community">Community Group</a> (CG). It's not any kind of evolution but the W3C is progressively deleting the concept of XG to CG.</p>
						<p>After a chair request, the group can be moved to the <q cite="http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">W3C Standards Track</q>: it will be turned into a Working Group (WG). Because subscription to WG are not open: there are two way to join them: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Be an employee of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List" target="_blank">W3C Member organization</a>  and ask to join (Firms have to pay a fee to be member),
							<li>Be an <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/invexp.html" target="_blank">invited expert</a>. 
						</ul>
						<p>When reaching the recommendation track, the work is far from done. The recommendation will pass theses steps <span class="ref">Dan Burnett, <em>W3C Recommendation Track</em> [Online]. Available: http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/wiki/images/5/5c/Webrtc_w3c_rec_track.pdf</span>:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Working Draft (WD): published as often as possible,</li>
							<li>Last Call Working Draft (LC): the document is technically complete,</li>
							<li>Candidate Recommendation (CR): the document is considered as stable,</li>
							<li>Proposed Recommendation (PR),</li>
							<li>W3C Recommendation (REC)</li>
						</ol>
						<p>For some standards it can take years to complete this procedure. That's why it's important to have working implementation as soon as possible, even if the recommendation is not complete, is order to spread the standard.</p>
						<p>At least before publishing the <em>Candidate recommendation</em>, a test suite shoud be available allowing people doing the implementation to clearly know if their implementation is correct or not. As of January 2012, there is no complete test suite for WebID which leads to problem such as somple implementation considerating that a WebID profile is correct and some considerating that there is a problem.</p>

				<h2>Node.js</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> (Node) is a software system which aims to produce <strong>highly scalable application</strong>. Programs are written in <span title="ECMAScript - ECMA-262, 5th edition">JavaScript</span>. Node is built ontop of google's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/" target="_blank">V8 engine</a> which is the open source JavaScript engine used for instance in Google Chrome.</p>
					<p>To be highly scalable, Node uses <strong>event based</strong> programmings.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/thread.png" title="Thread based programming" />
						<figcaption>This image shows a single thread: when a client is connected, the thread is blocked (represented in red) while the final result is not ready. Thus, Apache thread is blocked waiting (doing nothing) during long I/O operations such as writing to disk or database.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Traditional servers such as Apache spawns a new thread (or uses one of a pool) to handle each request. This thread will be used only for this request as long as the whole process is not finished. If other request arrive, they are put in the queue waiting for the thread to be avaiable.</p>
					<p>This approach does not provide good performance because of the memory cost of thread (or process) management. In order to scale well, this kind of server must uses lot of threads. But large numbers of threads leads to overloading the machine and synchronization problems.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/event.png" title="Event base programming"/>
						<figcaption>Node runs user's code in a loop called the event loop. Inspired from <span class="ref">Mixu, <em>Intro to Node.JS for .NET Developers</em>, [Online]. Available: http://www.aaronstannard.com/post/2011/12/14/Intro-to-NodeJS-for-NET-Developers.aspx</span></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Node works differently: it uses mainly an event loop that execute your code in a single thread. This loop handle all incoming connections, that's why potentially long operations (such as network or disk I/O, database queries, etc) must be executed asynchronously (with the use of callback) on workers threads.</p>
					<p>In order to defer long operation to other thread, Node supports the brand new <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/" target="_blank">HTML5 Web Workers</a> to delegate work to other threads.</p>
					<p>Many features of JavaScript helps to do event-driven programs effectively (with a minimum of line of code). Moreover, the way that Node is coded allows to do painlessly: there is no thread management nor synchronization functions...</p>
					<p>Node is under heavy development: cores <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s may change at any time. It could be even a an advantage or a problem. An advantage because if bugs are found or new features requested, development teams can react quickly. But it is also a problem when, for example, the number of arguments of a function change from a version to another: it may require additional work to follow Node's quick development.</p>
					<p><a href="http://npmjs.org" target="_blank">npm</a> is Node's package manager which permits to install packages (with the additional possibility to add your own c++ wrappers if needed), and even to publish your own package on a centralized platform. On January 7<sup>th</sup> 2012, there are more than six thousand package available which are covering a wide range of functionalities such as template engines, web pages parsing, certificate management... Anyone wan publish a package to npm registry with only a few lines.</p>

			<h1>Project</h1>
				<h2>Organization / Tools</h2>
					<p>We have chosen to use the platform <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to store our code because of three main reasons:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The revision control system <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is more and more used.</li>
						<li>Our aim is to encourage re-usability of our code: GitHub allows anybody to contribute by proposing addition or correction. Moreover it gives a good visibility on our work.</li>
						<li>GitHub is the official forge of Node.js and almost all npm packages are using GitHub. Being on the same platform allows us to quickly post bug report and follow related projects.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For intern communication, we used a wiki (powered by <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org" target="_blank">dokuwiki</a>, hosted on a personal server, <a href="http://wiki.magnetik.org/projet_asr" target="_blank">available here</a>) to share the minutes of ours meetings, important links about our research, etc. </p>
					<p>To generate our modules documentation, we used the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/" target="_blank">JSDoc toolkit</a>. It uses in-line annotation (mostly the same as <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html" target="_blank">Javadoc</a>) within the code (such as @param to describe a function parameter) to create a user-friendly documentation. An example of HTML output can be found <a href="http://magnetik.github.com/node-earl/doc/symbols/EarlDocument.html" target="_blank">on github</a>.</p>
				<h2>Research on related technologies </h2>
					<p>Before starting to code, we had to make research on many subjects related to WebID that where totally unknown to us (RDF and its serialization RDF/XML and Turtle, <abbr title="Transport Security Layer">TLS</abbr>, X509 certificate, <abbr title="Friend of a Friend">FOAF</abbr>, ...).</p>
					<p>After having a good comprehension of theses technologies and noticing that there wasn't much informations in our native language (French), we created a few articles on Wikipedia to help spreading thoses technologies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebID#Protocole_WebID" target="_blank">WebID</a>,</li>
						<li><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntaxe)" target="_blank">Turtle (syntaxe)</a>,</li>
						<li><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3" target="_blank">Notation3</a>,</li>
						<li><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_and_Report_Language" target="_blank">Evaluation and Report Language</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>By writing small summaries of theses technologies and rephrasing already existing articles, this helped us to have a clearer view.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>Existent</h2>
					<p>We searched if other people have already done some work on WebID with Node. A Google research didn't gave any result, neither a search on GitHub, but someone mentioned an implementation on the WebID XG list. After contacting the author, <a href="http://antoniogarrote.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Antonio Garrote</a>, he put <a href="https://github.com/antoniogarrote/NodeJS-WebID-demo" target="_blank">his code</a> on his <a href="https://github.com/antoniogarrote" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>. We have identified one main problem: the lack of RDF library in JavaScript.</p>
					<h3>JavaScript RDF lib</h3>
						<p>There are a few RDF libraries (in pure JavaScript or wrappers to other libs) available on the Internet. The following matrix shows RDF support for the main libraries.</p>
						<table>

						</table>
						<p>We have seen in the context that Node.js application have to do the least number of operation in the main thread. As a matter of fact the support of WebWorkers of <strong>rdfstore-js</strong> was decisive even if it does not support RDF/XML.</p>
						<p>To uses this library, we used a <span title="http://semola-rdf.appspot.com">web service</span> that translate RDF/XML to Turtle. </p>
				<h2>Programming</h2>
					<p>We started working with Node.Js 0.5.10 which didn't had the <em>Subject Alternative Name</em> available in the certificate. After a <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/1286">bug request</a> this as been added to Node for the 0.6.0 beta version.</p>
					<p>In order to clearly seperate our different modules, we creates four different github repositories:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/magnetik/node-webid" target="_blank">node-webid</a>: contains the core WebID implementation.</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/magnetik/node-webid-demo" target="_blank">node-webid-demo</a>: contains a demo of our implementation</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/magnetik/passport-webid" target="_blank">passport-webid</a>: contains an implementation of WebID login with the <a href="http://passportjs.org/" targe="_blank">passport framework</a>.</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/magnetik/node-earl" target="_blank">node-earl</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>node-webid</h3>
						<p>This is our core implementation. </p>
						<p>Our public API is simple, example of basic usage:</p>

						<p>We can see that adding WebID login to a website is quite easy. Otherwise it require the server to use TLS. </p>
						<p>This module is available on npm (<a href="http://search.npmjs.org/#/webid">search.npmjs.org/#/webid</a>): developpers which wants to use our code, just have to type : <code>npm install webid</code>, and the library (and its dependencies) will be installed on their working directory.</p>

					<h3>passport-webid</h3>
						<p>Almost all developpers using Node.js for web usage use the framework <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">express</a> framework, or at least the middleware <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/" target="_blank">Connect</a>. Theses framework/middleware helps developers to program their application without worrying of their underlying consideration such as routes mapping, sessions etc.</p>
						<p>Passport is an identification middleware wich can be used with connect or express. It's designed to handle many "strategies",  from classic login/password, to OpenID, facebook connect, and now... WebID !</p>
						<p>Our module is now available as a passport strategy which means that anyone can use it with even less line of code that our "standard" example</p>
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<h2>Issues</h2>
					<p>The main issue we had to face was the lack of good implementation for some standards: RDF and TLS.</p>
					<p>Following the very first steps of a new W3C recommendation was quite exciting but reading more than 400 messages per month was hard, that's why we didn't participate much in the discussions. </p>
